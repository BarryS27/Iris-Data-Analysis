# Iris Flower Data Analysis & Visualization

## 📝 Project Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic Iris dataset. The primary focus of this project is to practice data manipulation and storytelling through visualization using Python's data science ecosystem.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook (`Iris_Flower.ipynb`)
* **Libraries:** * `pandas` for data handling
  * `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for advanced data visualization

## 📊 Core Features
The current analysis focuses on identifying patterns among the three Iris species:
* **Distribution Analysis:** Histograms to visualize the spread of sepal and petal dimensions.
* **Relationship Mapping:** Scatter plots and pair plots to observe clustering behaviors between features.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/BarryS27/Iris-Flower-Data-Analysis.git`
2. **Run the analysis:** Open `Iris_Flower.ipynb` in your preferred Jupyter environment.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
Currently, this project highlights visualization skills. Future versions will include:
* **Statistical Inference:** Implementing hypothesis testing (e.g., T-tests) to validate findings.
* **Machine Learning:** Building classification models (KNN or Random Forest) to predict species based on input data.
